# Capability: Manage References


## Scope

This capability covers all ways a user can define what content belongs in a collection: adding references from outside the collection context (e.g., from search results or concept detail), creating references from inside the collection, previewing reference results without saving, tracing a concept back to the reference that brought it in, transforming existing references, and removing references.

---

## Adding References from Outside the Collection (Add to Collection)

This is the most common path for Terminology Implementers building a dictionary. The user encounters a concept elsewhere in TBv3 and wants to add it to a collection they own.

### Entry Points
- Concept Detail (split view or full page) → "Add to Collection" CTA ✅ implemented
- Concept row in Search Results → action button or right-click menu ⬜ not yet wired
- Concept row while browsing a repository → action button or right-click menu ⬜ not yet wired
- Hierarchy view node → "Add to Collection" action ⬜ not yet wired

### Interaction Flow
1. User clicks "Add to Collection"
2. A dialog opens (`src/components/common/AddToCollectionDialog.jsx`):
   - **Collection selector**: searchable autocomplete of all collections the user has edit access to (personal + org), grouped by owner; live-filtered by collection name, ID, short code, or owner — no debounce. Each option shows the collection name on the left and a `RepoChip` on the right; the chip tooltip activates after a 1-second hover. Only HEAD collections are shown (you can only add references to HEAD).
   - **Cascade selector** (rendered via `src/components/common/CascadeSelector.jsx`):
     - **None** — add the concept only; no mappings or target concepts
     - **Source Mappings** — add the concept plus all its mappings within the same source (`method=sourcemappings`)
     - **OpenMRS** — traverse Q-AND-A and CONCEPT-SET mappings recursively, returning all reachable concepts and mappings (`method=sourcetoconcepts&mapTypes=Q-AND-A,CONCEPT-SET&cascadeLevels=*&returnMapTypes=*`)
     - **Custom** — expands an inline form (left-bordered) to specify `method`, `mapTypes`, `excludeMapTypes`, `cascadeLevels`, and `returnMapTypes` manually
   - **Transform** checkbox (default: unchecked) — applies the OpenMRS transform (`transformReferences=openmrs_concept_reference`) on top of the selected cascade. Only relevant for OpenMRS or custom `sourcetoconcepts` cascades. Shown with a `?` help icon tooltip explaining its purpose.
   - **Preview API call** (default collapsed): toggled by a chip button; shows the full `PUT /:owner/collections/:collection/references/` request with query string and request body, updating live as collection and cascade options change
3. User confirms → `PUT /[owner]/collections/[collection]/references/` with `data.expressions` containing the concept URL (version stripped) and `cascade` set to the selected method; cascade query params appended as needed
4. Results displayed inline: successful additions shown in light blue rows (concept ID + message); failures shown in a two-column table (Reference | Error) with human-readable error descriptions unwrapped from the API's expression-keyed envelope, including conflicting reference IDs and conflicting concept names
5. On completion the form locks; user can close

### Version Consistency Warning
> **M42 MVP deliverable — not yet implemented.** This is the primary version locking UX for the M42 showcase.

- Before submission, detect whether the concept version that a user intends to add to a collection based on the user's context (let's call this the **intended concept version**) would be different than the **resolved concept version** based on the collection HEAD's auto-expansion's locked source version for that source
- If a mismatch is detected, show a warning in the dialog before the user confirms
- If no mismatch (or the collection has no locked source version yet), proceed silently with no warning

**Happy path (best practice):**
- **Add unversioned reference and rebuild the expansion** — the expansion re-evaluates all unversioned references against the latest locked source version, so the new reference will resolve correctly
- The warning dialog should include a "Go to collection to rebuild" CTA that takes the user to the collection's Versions + Expansions tab; the rebuild itself is triggered there, not inline in this dialog

**Less happy paths (presented as secondary options):**
- **Add unversioned reference without rebuilding** — the reference is added but will resolve to the old locked version v[Y] until the expansion is rebuilt
- **Add version-pinned reference** — not recommended unless the user explicitly wants to pin to a specific version; shown with a caution label

> **M42 scope boundary:** The warning UI is M42. The guided rebuild workflow (diff-then-confirm, alongside expansion) is **post-M42** — users are directed to the Versions + Expansions tab to trigger the rebuild manually.

> **Technical constraint — CIEL and concept versioning:** CIEL's current import process creates a new concept version and mapping version for every resource on every import, even when content has not meaningfully changed. A naive version-number comparison will therefore always show all concepts as "changed." The version mismatch check must use **smart checksums** (not raw concept version comparison) to distinguish real clinical changes from no-op version bumps. This is a two-pass check: (1) identify if a newer concept version exists → (2) compare smart checksums to determine if there is a meaningful difference. See `01_objects/version.md` and ADR-003 for checksum details.

## Add References (Within Collection)

> **Ticket:** ocl_issues#2431 — CTA / Reference / Add (within Collection)

Used when the user is already in the collection context and wants to define what content to include. The primary tools are a direct expression input field and an optional source/collection seed that builds the base path automatically.

### M42 Scope

| Feature | M42? |
|---|---|
| Expression input field | ✅ M42 |
| Source / Collection quick-search seed | ✅ M42 |
| Version selector (with locked-version warning) | ✅ M42 |
| Reference Type selector (Concepts / Mappings) | ✅ M42 |
| Bulk Add (comma-separated concept or mapping IDs) | ✅ M42 |
| Include / Exclude toggle | ✅ M42 |
| Cascade selector | ✅ M42 |
| Preview panel (`ReferencePreviewPanel` — #2007) | ✅ M42 |
| Intensional filter builder (Property / Operator / Value) | ⬜ Post-M42 |
| Search-and-select individual concepts from a source | ⬜ Post-M42 |

### Entry Point

Collection → References tab → `+ Add References` button

- Visible to users with edit access only
- Disabled (with tooltip) when viewing a released version; HEAD only
- Not shown to read-only users

### Component

`src/components/collections/AddReferencesDialog.jsx`

---

### Dialog Sections

#### 1. Source / Collection (seed field)

Searchable autocomplete of all sources and collections in OCL — not scoped to the current user's ownership. Typing searches by name, ID, short code, and owner.

- **Optional** — the user can type an expression directly without using the seed at all
- On selection: Version selector and Reference Type selector appear; the Expression field is populated with the base path
- **If the user has already typed a non-empty expression** before selecting a source/collection, show a warning inline: *"This will replace the current expression."* — selection only proceeds if the user confirms (or the field is empty)

#### 2. Version Selector

Appears after a source/collection is selected. Shows **Latest** at the top, followed by all released versions in descending order. HEAD is not a selectable option.

The dropdown options are ordered as follows:

1. **Locked (Currently {locked_version_id})** — only shown when the collection's expansion has already locked this source/collection to a specific version. Selecting this option produces the same unversioned expression path as Latest. Shown as the top and pre-selected option when applicable.
2. **Latest (Currently {latest_released_version_id})** — always shown. A dynamic pseudo-option, not a pinned version. Produces an **unversioned expression path** (e.g., `/orgs/CIEL/sources/CIEL/`) so the reference resolves against whatever version the expansion is configured to use. The "(Currently vXXX)" label is informational context only.
3. **Released version IDs** — listed below Latest in descending order. Selecting one produces a version-pinned expression path (e.g., `/orgs/CIEL/sources/CIEL/v2024-08-01/`).

**When the collection has a locked version:** "Locked..." is pre-selected. If the user selects any other option (Latest or a specific version ID), show a warning:
> ⚠️ *Your collection is pinned to {locked_version_id}. This reference will differ from the locked version.*

**When the collection has no locked version:** "Locked..." is not shown; "Latest..." is pre-selected; no warning on any selection.

#### 3. Reference Type Selector

Appears after a source/collection is selected. Dropdown with two options:

| Option | Appended to expression |
|---|---|
| **Concepts** (default) | `concepts/` |
| **Mappings** | `mappings/` |

Changing this updates the seeded expression path. If the user has manually edited the expression past the base path, changing the type shows the same overwrite warning as above.

#### 4. Expression Field

Always visible and always editable regardless of whether the seed fields are used.

The seeded base path format depends on whether a source or collection was selected:

| Seed type | Seeded format (Latest / unversioned) | Seeded format (specific version) |
|---|---|---|
| **Source** | `/{ownerType}/{owner}/sources/{source}/concepts/` | `/{ownerType}/{owner}/sources/{source}/{version}/concepts/` |
| **Collection** | `/{ownerType}/{owner}/collections/{collection}/concepts/` | `/{ownerType}/{owner}/collections/{collection}/{version}/concepts/` |

- Placeholder when empty: `e.g. /orgs/CIEL/sources/CIEL/concepts/1234/`
- User may append anything after the base path: a concept or mapping ID, query params (`?conceptClass=Test&locale=en`), etc.
- Submitting only the base path (e.g., `/orgs/CIEL/sources/CIEL/concepts/`) without further qualification is valid — it creates a reference that resolves to all concepts in that repo at the given version

#### 5. Bulk Add

Collapsed by default; toggled open via `[+ Bulk Add by ID ▼]`.

- **Requires** a source or collection to be seeded (IDs must be expanded into full URLs; not available without a repo context)
- Textarea accepting comma-separated IDs for the currently selected Reference Type: `1234, 5678, 9012`
- When Reference Type is **Concepts**, IDs expand under `concepts/`; when Reference Type is **Mappings**, IDs expand under `mappings/`
- When Bulk Add IDs are present **and** the expression field contains a value beyond the seeded base path, show a warning:
  > ⚠️ *These IDs will be submitted instead of the expression above.*
- On submit, each ID is expanded into a separate extensional expression using the seeded repo path:
  - From a source: `/{ownerType}/{owner}/sources/{source}/{version}/{resourceType}/{id}/`
  - From a collection: `/{ownerType}/{owner}/collections/{collection}/{version}/{resourceType}/{id}/`
  - `{resourceType}` is `concepts` or `mappings`, based on the selected Reference Type
- Submitted as N expressions in a single batch API call; Preview also batches all N

**Bulk Add and Expression are mutually exclusive on submit:** if Bulk Add IDs are present, those N expressions are submitted and the expression field value is ignored.

#### 6. Include / Exclude

Dropdown, defaults to **Include**.

Applies to all expressions in the submission — you cannot mix include and exclude references in a single dialog open.

| Option | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Include** | Standard inclusion reference (`include: true`) |
| **Exclude** | Exclusion reference (`include: false`); shown with Exclude chip in the References list |

#### 7. Cascade Selector

Same `CascadeSelector` component used in `AddToCollectionDialog`. Applies to all expressions in the submission.

#### 8. Preview Panel

`ReferencePreviewPanel` (#2007), collapsed by default, toggled open via `[Preview ▼]`.

- In expression mode: fires on the single expression value
- In Bulk Add mode: fires on all N expanded expressions as a batch
- Version mismatch and zero-result warnings are surfaced here (see `§ Reference Preview`)
- Preview re-fires automatically when the expression, version, or cascade params change while the panel is open (debounce: 500ms)

---

### Interaction Flow

1. User clicks `+ Add References` from the References tab toolbar
2. Dialog opens; expression field is empty with placeholder
3. *(Optional)* User types in the Source / Collection seed field and selects a source
4. Version selector appears — user confirms or changes the version; locked-version warning shown if applicable
5. Reference Type selector appears — user selects Concepts or Mappings (default: Concepts)
6. Expression field is populated with the seeded base path; user edits as needed (adds ID, query params, etc.)
   — *or* —
   User expands Bulk Add and pastes comma-separated concept or mapping IDs, depending on the selected Reference Type
7. User sets Include/Exclude and cascade options
8. *(Optional)* User opens Preview panel to evaluate before committing
9. User clicks **Add Reference(s)**
10. `PUT /:ownerType/:owner/collections/:collection/references/` with `{ data: { expressions: [...] } }` + cascade query params
11. Results displayed inline: successes in light blue rows; failures in a Reference / Error table (same pattern as `AddToCollectionDialog`)
12. Form locks on completion; user closes

---

### Submit Behaviour

| Mode | `expressions` array |
|---|---|
| Expression only | `[expressionFieldValue]` |
| Bulk Add only | `[/{source}/{version}/{resourceType}/{id1}/, ..., /{source}/{version}/{resourceType}/{idN}/]`, where `{resourceType}` is `concepts` or `mappings` |
| Both filled | Bulk Add takes precedence; expression field value is **not** submitted (warning shown before submit) |

Include/Exclude is sent as `include: false` on the reference body for exclude references. Cascade params appended as query params per `CascadeSelector` output.

---

### Validation

- **Add button disabled** when: expression field is empty and no Bulk Add IDs are present
- **Bulk Add requires a source or collection seed**: the Bulk Add textarea is disabled with tooltip *"Select a source or collection above to use Bulk Add"* until a repo is seeded
- **Version mismatch**: surfaced non-destructively in the Preview panel; the three action choices (add unversioned + rebuild / add without rebuilding / pin to this version) are presented in the dialog's submit area if a mismatch is detected (same pattern as `AddToCollectionDialog` — see `§ Version Consistency Warning`)

---

### Post-M42: Intensional Filter Builder

The Intensional reference pattern (`/orgs/:org/sources/:source/concepts/?q=...`) can be authored via the Expression field today using raw query params. A structured filter builder UI (Property | Operator | Value rows) that generates the query string automatically is deferred. See `tbv3-deferred-features.md`.

## Reference Preview (Without Persisting)

> **Ticket:** ocl_issues#2007 — CTA / Reference / Preview

Users can evaluate what a reference expression would resolve to before committing it. This is non-destructive: nothing is added to or removed from the collection.

### M42 Scope

| Entry Point | M42? |
|---|---|
| Preview panel within the Add to Collection dialog (`AddToCollectionDialog.jsx`) | ✅ M42 |
| Preview panel within the Add References dialog (`AddReferencesDialog.jsx`) | ✅ M42 (built as part of #2431) |
| Preview action on an existing reference row in the References list | ✅ M42 |

---

### API

**Endpoint:** `POST /:ownerType/:owner/collections/:collection/references/preview/`

The endpoint accepts multiple expressions in a single call and returns one result object per expression. This is important for batch operations (e.g., previewing Bulk Add IDs before adding them all at once via the Add References dialog).

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "expressions": [
      "/orgs/CIEL/sources/CIEL/concepts/1234/",
      "/orgs/CIEL/sources/CIEL/concepts/5678/"
    ]
  },
  "cascade": "sourcemappings"
}
```

**Query params (appended as needed):**
- `cascade` — cascade method string (e.g., `sourcemappings`, `sourcetoconcepts`)
- `transformReferences` — optional transform (e.g., `openmrs_concept_reference`)
- Additional cascade params as needed (`mapTypes`, `cascadeLevels`, `returnMapTypes`)

**Response:** Array of preview result objects, one entry per input expression:
```json
[
  {
    "reference": "/orgs/CIEL/sources/CIEL/concepts/1234/",
    "new": {
      "concepts": [ /* ConceptListSerializer[] — first 25 */ ],
      "mappings": [ /* MappingListSerializer[] — first 25 */ ],
      "concepts_count": 1,
      "mappings_count": 3
    },
    "existing": {
      "concepts": [ /* ConceptListSerializer[] — first 25 */ ],
      "mappings": [ /* MappingListSerializer[] — first 25 */ ],
      "concepts_count": 0,
      "mappings_count": 0
    },
    "version_status": {
      "consistent": true,
      "canonical_source_version": "CIEL v2024-08-01",
      "resolved_source_version": "CIEL v2024-08-01"
    },
    "errors": [],
    "exclude": false
  },
  {
    "reference": "/orgs/CIEL/sources/CIEL/concepts/5678/",
    "new": { "concepts": [], "mappings": [], "concepts_count": 0, "mappings_count": 0 },
    "existing": { "concepts": [], "mappings": [], "concepts_count": 0, "mappings_count": 0 },
    "version_status": null,
    "errors": [
      { "type": "source_not_found", "message": "Source CIEL not found or not accessible." }
    ],
    "exclude": false
  }
]
```

> **API enhancement required:** The current `CollectionReferencesPreview` view returns a flat `concepts` / `mappings` array with no collection-membership awareness, version checking, or error taxonomy. The endpoint needs to be updated to:
> 1. Accept multiple expressions and return one result object per expression
> 2. Split resolved resources into `new` vs. `existing` groups by checking each against the collection's current expansion
> 3. Populate `version_status` by comparing the resolved source version against the auto-expansion's locked source version (see [Version Consistency](#version-consistency-warning) above)
> 4. Populate `errors` with typed error objects for any expression that cannot be evaluated
>
> The `concepts` / `mappings` arrays within each group are capped at 25 items each; use the `*_count` fields for display totals.

---

### Warnings and Errors

The preview response surfaces two distinct concern types per expression. These are displayed in the panel above the result rows, one alert per affected expression.

#### Version Inconsistency (Warning)

Shown when one or more result objects have `version_status.consistent === false`. This is the same condition described in [Version Consistency Warning](#version-consistency-warning) above — surfaced here so the user sees the conflict before deciding to submit.

The warning is a single collapsible alert regardless of how many expressions are affected. It does not repeat per-expression.

**Collapsed (default):**
> ⚠️ **{N} reference(s) will resolve to a different source version than your collection is pinned to.** ▼

**Expanded (user clicks ▼):**

A table drops down listing each affected expression:

| Reference | Resolves to | Collection pinned to |
|---|---|---|
| `CIEL/concepts/1234/` | CIEL v2023-10-01 | CIEL v2024-08-01 |
| `CIEL/concepts/5678/` | CIEL v2023-10-01 | CIEL v2024-08-01 |

- Expression column shows the concept ID portion of the URL (not the full path) for readability
- Resolved version and collection version are shown as source+version chips
- If all affected references resolve to the same mismatched version, the table makes this obvious at a glance

The alert is informational only within the preview panel. The action choices (Add unversioned + rebuild / Add unversioned without rebuilding / Pin to this version) are presented in the parent dialog's submit area, not inline in the panel.

If `version_status` is `null` for all results (collection has no locked source version yet), no version warning is shown.

> **Unresolvable Reference (Error) is post-M42** — see `tbv3-deferred-features.md § Reference Preview: Unresolvable Reference Error Taxonomy`. For M42, expressions that fail to resolve are shown as empty results; no per-type error messaging is displayed.

#### Zero-result reference (not an error, a warning)

When `errors` is empty but `new.concepts_count + new.mappings_count + existing.concepts_count + existing.mappings_count === 0`, show a soft warning rather than an error:

> ⚠️ This reference resolves to 0 resources. It will be saved as an empty reference.

This is a valid state (intensional references may legitimately return zero results today but resolve in the future), so saving is not blocked — the user just needs to acknowledge.

### Component: `ReferencePreviewPanel`

**File:** `src/components/common/ReferencePreviewPanel.jsx`

**Props:**

| Prop | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|

### Result Grouping

Results arrive pre-grouped from the API. Each expression's result object contains `new` and `existing` sub-objects; resources with `errors` have empty `new` and `existing` objects.

| Group | Icon | Source in response |
|---|---|---|
| **New** | ✅ green | `result.new` — resources not yet in the collection's current expansion |
| **Already in collection** | ⚠️ yellow | `result.existing` — resources already in the collection's current expansion |
| **Unresolvable** | ❌ red | `result.errors` is non-empty |

When previewing multiple expressions, results for all expressions are merged into these groups (New, Already in Collection, Unresolvable). Version inconsistency and zero-result warnings are shown per-expression above the merged result list.

---

### Summary Bar

Shown above the result rows (below any per-expression warning/error alerts):

> `X new · Y already in collection · Z unresolvable`

Zero-count segments are omitted. When multiple expressions are previewed, counts are aggregated across all expressions.

---

### Result Row Display

Each row shows one concept or mapping. No selection controls — rows are read-only.

**Concept row:**
```
[CIEL] 1234 · Malaria, unspecified          [1 mapping]
```
- Source chip (abbreviated source name)
- Concept ID · Display name
- Mapping count badge if mappings > 0

**Mapping row (shown below its parent concept, indented):**
```
    [SAME-AS]  ICD-10-WHO: A09
```
- Map type chip
- Target code · Target source (external) or concept chip (internal)

**Pagination / overflow:**
- If the total across all groups exceeds 100 rows: show first 100, then a muted footer: `"…and N more resources. Add the reference to see the full list."`
- Within a group, if the `concepts` or `mappings` array is capped at 25 but the `*_count` is higher, show an inline "…and N more [concepts/mappings]" note within that group

---

### Integration: Add to Collection Dialog

In `AddToCollectionDialog.jsx`:

- Add a collapsible "Preview" section below the `CascadeSelector` and above the Submit button
- Collapsed by default; toggled open by a `Preview` chip-button
- When open, `ReferencePreviewPanel` is mounted with `expressions={[conceptUrl]}`, `cascadeParams`, and `collectionUrl`
- Preview updates live when cascade params change (re-fires on each cascade change while panel is open)
- **Version consistency:** If the preview returns `version_status.consistent === false`, the version mismatch alert is shown in the panel. The Submit area below should also reflect the three action choices described in [Version Consistency Warning](#version-consistency-warning) (Add unversioned + rebuild / Add unversioned without rebuilding / Pin to version)

---

### Integration: Add References Dialog

In `AddReferencesDialog.jsx` (to be built as part of #2431):

- "Preview results" toggle below the expression/cascade fields; collapsed by default
- When open, `ReferencePreviewPanel` is mounted with the current expressions array and cascade params
- Preview re-fires when expressions or cascade change (debounce: 500ms after last change)
- Multiple expressions from Bulk Add are passed as a single batch; results are merged in the panel

---

## Reference Presentation in the References Tab

> **Milestone note:** The flat list view and detail split view are part of the current milestone. Bulk Transform and Remove remain in MVP scope but land in a later MVP milestone. Inline row expansion in the list itself and Group by Source are also later-milestone enhancements — see `04_surfaces/references-tab.md` and the pending tickets in `tbv3-ticket-execution-log.md` Section 6. The concept → mapping tree is already used inside the detail split view's Expansion tab for MVP.

### List View
- Table columns: Expression | Type (Extensional/Intensional/Cascade/Exclude) | Resolved Count | Version Pinned? | Status
- Resolved Count: number of concepts/mappings this reference evaluates to in the current expansion
- Version Pinned: badge shown if the reference is locked to a specific source version; warning badge if that version differs from the auto-expansion's locked source version
- Status: Active | Warning | Error

### Reference Detail (Row Click → Split View)
- Full expression (not truncated)
- Reference type and cascade settings
- Uses the same split-view interaction model as Concept Detail
- Header-level `Actions ▾` menu includes reference utilities such as download and share
- Footer shows the last-resolved timestamp plus quick download/share actions
- Expansion tab shows the resolved resources as an expandable concept → mapping tree, including an orphaned mappings group when applicable
- "Trace back": any concept in the expansion can link to the reference(s) that brought it in

---

## Reference Transforms (HEAD Only)

> **Ticket:** ocl_issues#2433 - CTA / Reference / Transform
> **Reference ticket:** ocl_issues#2274 - checkbox-based actions for references

Transforms let an editor change the version pinning strategy or expression pattern for selected collection references in bulk. They are only available on the collection's HEAD version. This is distinct from Cascade's Transform option, which is used while adding references and sends `transformReferences` to the preview/add API.

### #2433 Scope

- Entry point: Collection -> References tab -> select one or more references with checkboxes -> `Transform`
- Applies to selected collection references only; no row-level transform action in MVP
- Supports bulk operation with before/after preview before commit
- Mixed selections are grouped by reference/pinning type so each group can expose only the transform options that apply to it
- Preserves reference metadata that is not part of the selected transform, including include/exclude state and cascade settings, unless the transform type explicitly changes it
- Successful transform queues re-expansion of the collection HEAD
- Released collection versions are immutable; transform controls are disabled with the same HEAD-only messaging used by Add and Remove

### #2433 Available Transforms

1. **Unpin to HEAD / non-versioned reference** - Removes source or resource version pinning so the reference resolves dynamically through the collection expansion strategy
   - Repo-versioned source path: `/:owner/sources/:source/:repoVersion/concepts/:id/` -> `/:owner/sources/:source/concepts/:id/`
   - Deprecated resource-versioned path: `/:owner/sources/:source/concepts/:id/:resourceVersion/` -> `/:owner/sources/:source/concepts/:id/`
   - Use when: cleaning up old or overly pinned references, including the #2274 "Transform to non-versioned reference" workflow
2. **Lock to repo version** - Changes an unversioned reference to a repo-versioned reference
   - `/:owner/sources/:source/concepts/:id/` -> `/:owner/sources/:source/:repoVersion/concepts/:id/`
   - Default target version: the collection expansion's currently locked source version for that source, when available
   - If no locked version exists, user must choose a released source version; default to the latest released version if the API can determine it
   - Use when: the user wants to freeze selected HEAD-resolving references to a specific released source version
3. **Convert deprecated resource-versioned reference to repo-versioned reference** - Rewrites old resource-versioned references into the modern repo-versioned pattern
   - `/:owner/sources/:source/concepts/:id/:resourceVersion/` -> `/:owner/sources/:source/:repoVersion/concepts/:id/`
   - If the resource version maps to exactly one released repo version, preselect that version
   - If it maps to multiple possible repo versions, user must choose a target version or rule before preview can be committed
   - Use when: the user wants to keep version pinning while removing deprecated resource-versioned URLs
4. **Expression rewrite** - Applies a controlled expression rewrite across selected references
   - Intended for consistent pattern changes, such as replacing a base repo path, converting a concepts expression to a mappings expression, or updating query parameters on intensional references
   - Must validate that each rewritten expression is parseable and previewable before commit
   - Free-form text replacement is allowed only if the preview reports each before/after expression and blocks invalid rewrites

> **Post-v3:** A transform that lets a user update the pinned version of a repo-versioned reference (e.g., from `v2023` to `v2024`) without changing the reference pattern is deferred to post-v3. See `tbv3-deferred-features.md`.

### #2433 Eligibility

| Transform | Valid selected references | Invalid selected references |
|---|---|---|
| Unpin to HEAD / non-versioned | Repo-versioned references; deprecated resource-versioned references | Already unversioned references; references without a source/collection version segment |
| Lock to repo version | Unversioned source/collection references | Already pinned references; expressions whose target repo/version cannot be identified |
| Convert deprecated resource-versioned to repo-versioned | Deprecated resource-versioned references | Unversioned references; already repo-versioned references |
| Expression rewrite | References that match the configured rewrite rule and can be parsed after rewrite | Non-matching references; invalid rewritten expressions; references whose preview fails |

Bulk transforms may include invalid selected references. Invalid references are skipped, not silently changed, and are shown in the preview report with a reason.

### #2433 Mixed Selection Grouping

When selected references include different expression or pinning patterns, the dialog groups them before asking for transform inputs. The grouping should be based on what options are valid, not only on display labels.

| Group | Examples | Available transform options |
|---|---|---|
| Unversioned references | `/:owner/sources/:source/concepts/:id/` | Lock to repo version; Expression rewrite |
| Repo-versioned references | `/:owner/sources/:source/:repoVersion/concepts/:id/` | Unpin to HEAD / non-versioned; Expression rewrite |
| Deprecated resource-versioned references | `/:owner/sources/:source/concepts/:id/:resourceVersion/` | Unpin to HEAD / non-versioned; Convert deprecated resource-versioned to repo-versioned; Expression rewrite |
| Intensional/filter references | `/:owner/sources/:source/concepts/?q=...` | Transform options depend on whether the base repo path is pinned; Expression rewrite |
| Unsupported/unknown references | Expressions that cannot be parsed or classified | No transform; shown as skipped with reason |

Dialog behavior for mixed selections:
- Show a selected-reference summary by group, e.g. `8 selected: 3 unversioned, 4 repo-versioned, 1 unsupported`
- Each group has its own transform selector and required inputs
- A user may transform one group while leaving another group unchanged
- Groups with no valid transform remain visible as skipped so the user can see why they are not affected
- The final commit submits only rows that are Ready within groups that have an active transform selected

### #2433 Transform Dialog

1. User selects references in the References tab
2. User chooses `Transform`
3. Dialog opens with:
   - Selected count
   - Grouped summary of selected reference types
   - One expandable panel per reference group
4. Each group panel shows:
   - Group count and reference type/pinning pattern
   - Transform type selector scoped to valid options for that group
   - Target version selector when the selected transform needs a repo version
   - Expression rewrite controls when `Expression rewrite` is selected
   - Preview table for references in that group
5. Preview table shows one row per selected reference:
   - Current expression
   - Proposed expression
   - Current resolved source/version and result count, when available
   - Proposed resolved source/version and result count, when previewable
   - Status: Ready, Skipped, Warning, Error, Preview pending, or Preview too large
   - Reason for skipped/error rows
6. Commit button is disabled until at least one selected reference has `Ready` status and all required transform inputs are provided
7. On commit, only `Ready` rows are submitted; skipped rows are left unchanged
8. Results are shown inline after submission with counts for transformed, skipped, and failed references

### #2433 Preview and Safety Rules

- Preview is required before commit; users must see before/after expressions for every row that will be submitted
- The dialog must make partial application explicit: `X will be transformed`, `Y will be skipped`, `Z need attention`
- If a proposed transform changes resolved content count, show a warning rather than blocking by default
- If a proposed transform resolves to zero resources, show a warning and require explicit confirmation
- If a proposed transform cannot be previewed or produces an invalid expression, block that row from commit
- If every selected reference is invalid for the selected transform, disable commit and explain why
- Transform preview should use the same reference preview semantics as Add References where possible, so version mismatch and zero-result warnings behave consistently

### #2433 Large Reference Preview Handling

Some references resolve to very large result sets, and OCL may not be able to resolve them synchronously during transform preview. The transform dialog must handle this without timing out or blocking the whole selection.

- The preview has two layers:
  - **Structural preview**: validate the current expression, proposed expression, transform eligibility, target repo/version, include/exclude state, and cascade metadata without resolving all referenced resources
  - **Resolution preview**: compare resolved source/version and resolved resource counts when the API can provide them quickly
- A row can be `Ready` based on structural preview even when full resolution preview is unavailable, provided the expression is valid and the transform is deterministic
- If full resolution is too expensive, show `Preview too large` or `Resolution preview queued` in the resolution columns instead of an error
- Large-preview rows must clearly state that resolved counts/content changes could not be confirmed before commit
- If the API supports async preview jobs, the dialog should poll or refresh job status and update rows from `Preview pending` to Ready, Warning, Error, or Preview too large
- Async preview must be scoped per row or group so one large reference does not prevent smaller references from becoming Ready
- If an async preview is still pending, the user can commit only rows whose structural preview is Ready; pending rows remain unsubmitted unless the user explicitly chooses to include structurally ready rows without resolved counts
- Transform commit should not require downloading or rendering the resolved resource list for very large references
- After commit, the queued collection re-expansion remains the authoritative confirmation of final resolved content

### #2433 API Requirements

- Preferred API shape: a bulk transform endpoint that accepts selected reference IDs plus transform parameters and returns per-reference preview/commit results
- Preview responses should distinguish structural validation from full resolution, including statuses for async pending and too-large-to-resolve references
- If only lower-level update/delete/add APIs exist, the client must still present the operation as one bulk transform with per-reference results and must avoid losing include/exclude and cascade metadata
- Commit must be idempotent enough that retrying after a partial failure does not duplicate references
- The server response must expose enough data to refresh changed reference rows without a full page reload; a full list refresh is acceptable as a fallback

### #2433 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] References tab supports checkbox selection for reference rows and a header checkbox for visible rows
- [ ] Transform control is enabled when one or more references are selected on HEAD and disabled on released versions
- [ ] Mixed selected references are grouped by reference/pinning type with group-specific transform options
- [ ] Transform dialog supports Unpin to HEAD / non-versioned reference
- [ ] Transform dialog supports Lock to repo version
- [ ] Transform dialog supports converting deprecated resource-versioned references to repo-versioned references
- [ ] Transform dialog supports expression rewrite with before/after preview
- [ ] Invalid selected references are skipped with clear reasons
- [ ] User sees before/after expression, resolved version, and resolved count before commit
- [ ] Large references that cannot be resolved synchronously show structural preview plus a clear async/too-large resolution status
- [ ] Commit applies only eligible/ready rows and reports transformed/skipped/failed counts
- [ ] Successful transform queues or triggers collection HEAD re-expansion and updates the References tab

### #2433 Open Questions

- Confirm backend endpoint and request/response shape for transform preview and commit
- Confirm whether expression rewrite is in M42 MVP or should be a later milestone behind the version-lock/unpin transforms
- Confirm how to map deprecated resource-level versions to repo versions when more than one released repo version contains the resource version
- Confirm whether transform should preserve the original reference ID or create a replacement reference with a new ID
- Confirm whether "Lock to repo version" should default to the expansion's locked version, latest released version, or require explicit user choice when no expansion lock exists
- Confirm API threshold and status vocabulary for large references that cannot be synchronously resolved during preview
- Confirm whether users may commit structurally valid transforms when resolved counts are unavailable, or whether that should require an explicit confirmation checkbox

### Legacy Name Mapping

- Earlier SOW notes called `Unpin to HEAD / non-versioned reference` "Transform to Unversioned"
- Earlier SOW notes called `Convert deprecated resource-versioned reference to repo-versioned reference` "Transform to Repo-Versioned"
- Earlier SOW notes called `Lock to repo version` "Lock to Repo Version"

## Removing References

> **Ticket:** ocl_issues#2008 — CTA / Reference / Delete ✅ implemented

### Bulk Remove from References Tab

**Entry point:** Collection → References tab → checkbox selection → "Remove selected" (bulk action only; no row action menu)

**Confirmation dialog** (shown before deletion):
> "Remove [X] reference(s)?"
> "This will remove [Y] concepts and [Z] mappings from the collection expansion."

- Only possible on **HEAD** version (released versions are immutable)
- Successful removal queues a re-expansion of HEAD
- Dialog has Cancel and Remove (destructive) buttons — no type-to-confirm required

**API:** `DELETE /:ownerType/:owner/collections/:collection/references/` with body `{ "ids": [id1, id2, ...] }`

**Implementation (oclweb3):**
- `DeleteReferencesDialog` component: `src/components/collections/DeleteReferencesDialog.jsx`
- Delete button rendered as `toolbarControl` in `Search.jsx` when `resource === 'references'` and items are selected
- HEAD-only: button is disabled with tooltip "Not available in saved versions. Switch to HEAD to edit." when not on HEAD; derived from `props.url?.includes('/HEAD/')`
- Reference IDs sourced from selected result objects matched by `r.id`; concept/mapping counts summed from `reference.concepts` and `reference.mappings` fields

---

### Remove from Collection via Concept/Mapping Detail ✅ implemented

A secondary removal path: a user viewing a concept or mapping inside a collection can remove it directly from its detail split view without navigating to the References tab.

**Entry point:** Collection → Concepts/Mappings tab → select concept or mapping → detail panel → "Remove from collection" button (header area)

**Behavior:**
- Only visible when viewing a concept/mapping in a collection context (URL contains `/collections/`) AND on HEAD AND user has edit access
- Clicking the button opens `RemoveFromCollectionDialog`, which lists the reference expression(s) that bring this concept/mapping into the collection
- On confirm, deletes those references via the same `DELETE /references/` API call (using IDs from `concept.references` / `mapping.references`)
- On success, closes the detail panel

**References section in detail view:**
When a concept or mapping is fetched in a collection context, the API is called with `includeReferences=true`. The response includes a `references` array on the concept/mapping object. This is rendered as a "References" section at the bottom of the detail view (below checksums), showing each reference expression that brings the item into the collection.

**Implementation (oclweb3):**
- `RemoveFromCollectionDialog` component: `src/components/collections/RemoveFromCollectionDialog.jsx`
- `ResourceReferences` display component: `src/components/common/ResourceReferences.jsx` — used in both `ConceptDetails.jsx` and `MappingDetails.jsx`
- Collection context detected in `ConceptHome` / `MappingHome` via `props.repo?.type?.includes('Collection') || props.url?.includes('/collections/')`
- Fetch param: `includeReferences: true` added to concept/mapping GET when in collection context
- Remove button in `ConceptHeader.jsx` / `MappingHeader.jsx` — shown instead of "Add to Collection" when `isInCollection && repo?.version === 'HEAD'`

## Linked Source: Resolve to HEAD During Updates

> **Open question:** Whether HEAD-resolution during updates applies only to sources the user owns, or also to sources they do not own (e.g., CIEL), is still unresolved and requires a dedicated design decision. This is one of multiple workflow design areas that deserve dedicated time in the near term.

When a collection is being updated (typically after a new CIEL version is released):
- Unversioned references that previously resolved to a released version now need to be evaluated against HEAD of the source (to pick up new content) and then locked again when a new collection version is created
- This is part of the Update Collection to Latest Source Version workflow (see `03_workflows/`)
- The UI presents this as a guided flow, not a raw reference management task (see workflow doc for details)
